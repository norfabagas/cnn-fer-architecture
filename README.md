# cnn-fer-architecture
Facial Expression Recognition using FER2013 dataset.

# General
On this repository, I proposed CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) architecture. The performance then evaluated using confussion matrix.

# Dataset
For the dataset, I used FER2013 dataset by Kaggle. I converted the dataset from CSV into hdf5 data type.

# Architecture
For detailed architecture and parameters trained/used, check out facial_expression.ipynb
